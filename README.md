# PageRank-with-Spark
Implemented two different variations of Sergey Brin and Larry Page's Pagerank algorithm using the MapReduce programming paradigm. PageRank scores were used to represent the probability that a user is at some page at a given point in time. A discrete time Markov chain was used to model the behavior of users browsing the web.
